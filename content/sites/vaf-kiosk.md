This is a link to the "kiosk version" of the _Visualizing Abolition and Freedom_ site.  It's essentially the same as the other/public site, but without links to _Digital Grinnell_, and is intended to run on a mobile device adjacent to the art installation inside the _Humanities and Social Sciences Center_ (HSSC).
